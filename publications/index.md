In this talk a framework for globally optimizing pagination of
documents containing floats is demonstrated. As the main example Alice
in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was chosen. If such a document is
formatted using standard LaTeX it will result in a

At the moment the framework is still in its early stages and not yet
publically available as further research and development is needed.

In 2012, a question "How to influence the float placement in LaTeX" was asked on TeX.stackexchange and as there had been many earlier questions around this topic I decided to treat the topic in some depth and explain most of the mysteries that the underlying mechanism poses to people trying to use it successfully. Once my answer appeared on the web, people asked to see this converted into an article and I foolishly replied "only if this answer ends up becoming a `great' answer" (gets 100 votes). At the time of writing this article, the answer stands at 222 votes, so I had better make good on that promise.

+ Published paper, TUGboat volume 35, number 3, 2014

Regression tests are an important tool in any moderately complex programming environment. They allow the programmer to make extensive changes to their code while providing confidence that something that used to work still does. Extensive regression test suites have been an essential component of the maintenance and development of LaTeX2e and LaTeX3. A regression test suite is typically composed of a number of individual files that contain one or more testable units of the code being tested. A testable unit might be either a certain computation with an expected outcome, a series of logic tests, or---in particular for TeX-based code---material that is typeset and intended to achieve some particular formatting. During code development and before any new code is released to the public, this test suite can be compiled to ensure that any changes to the code have not introduced bugs or changed the behaviour compared to previous versions. As bugs in the code are reported, minimal examples demonstrating the bug often form test files of their own, showing that the bug has been fixed and won't re-occur. As TeX-based code operates in at least three different `modes' (mouth, stomach, and output), regression testing is more complex than simply asserting the outcome of certain programming logic. As part of the work of the LaTeX3 project, a new Lua-based testing environment has been written to support ongoing development. This testing environment, presented at the 2014 TUG conference in Portland, is suitable for use by the general TeX community.

In 1990 shortly after Don Knuth announced TeX 3.0 Frank gave a paper analyzing TeX's abilities as a typesetting engine.
This paper now revisits the findings from more than two decades ago to see  what
has been achieved since then, and perhaps more importantly, what can
be achieved now with computer power having multiplied by a huge factor
and last not least by the arrival of a number of successors to TeX
which have lifted some of the limitations identified back then.

In August 2010 the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) was finally listed on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) web page as a free software license. This marks the endpoint of a long set of discussions around the TeX community's predominant license. This article reflects on the history of the license; the way it came about and the reasons for its development and content. It explains why it was chosen even though alternative free licenses have been available at least from 1990 onwards. It appeared in the anniversary TUGboat issue No.100, TUGboat volume 32, number 1.
