# Getting LaTeX

LaTeX is <a href="http://www.debian.org/intro/free">free software</a> under the terms of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/lppl/">LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL)</a>. LaTeX is distributed through <a href="#ctan">CTAN servers</a> or comes as part of many easily installable and usable <a href="http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free">TeX distributions provided by the TeX User Group (TUG)</a> or third parties. If you run into trouble, visit the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/help/">help section</a>.

## TeX Distributions
If you're new to TeX and LaTeX or just want an easy installation, get a full TeX distribution. The TeX Users Group (TUG) has a <a href="http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free">list of notable distributions</a> that are entirely, or least primarily, free software.
<div class="row">
  <div class="col cell1of2">
    <p>LaTeX is not a stand-alone typesetting program in itself, but document preparation software that runs on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald E. Knuth</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX typesetting system</a>. TeX distributions usually bundle together all the parts needed for a working TeX system and they generally add to this both configuration and maintenance utilities. Nowadays LaTeX, and many of the packages built on it, form an important component of any major TeX distribution.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col cell1of2">
    <p>The LaTeX team cannot guarantee that TeX distributions, even recent ones, contain the most recent version of LaTeX. It may happen that you need a more recent LaTeX than the one that your favourite TeX distribution carries, e.g., in order to get a particular bug fix. In that case you will need to fetch LaTeX from CTAN and install it on top of your distribution. See below for details.</p>
